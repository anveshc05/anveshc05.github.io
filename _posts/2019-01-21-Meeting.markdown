# Progress
* A basic version of front-end deployed with search functionality.
* Some feature extraction techniques tried including **sound intensity** , **colour**. 
* **Video google** tried for player recognition and found to be compute intensive.

# Plan for next week
* Started working on a new website with different frameworks for making the work easier.
* Host the website while integrating the work done until now.
* Clean dataset to remove pre-match/ mid-match shows.
* Use NLP tools to improve search accuracy.
