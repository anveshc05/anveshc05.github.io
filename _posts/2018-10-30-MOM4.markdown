# Honours Project Meeting
## 30 October, 2018

Attendees: Anvesh, Dheeraj, Jawahar sir

# Talking Points
- Looked at color temperature and sound features
- Confused on whether we should merge clips based on search or not
- Confused on what to put on roadmap. What is feasible?
- Haven't hosted the website yet since Varun didn't reply to mail
- Don't convert features to clips, instead just store them
- Collect mean, variance
- Get gist features to classify goal posts, corners, etc
- Example query: "People moving fast in penalty box"
- two kinds of features - 1. color, motion sound, and 2. location of game
- Look at video google see if we can use their implementation as a final goal for event recognition like fouls, goals
- Final goal can be something like - mark a Messi and then using that find all Messi across all games

# Actionable Points
- Host website
- Collect more features
