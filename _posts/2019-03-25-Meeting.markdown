# Progress
* Worked on goal detection. Improvement of detection by using multiple features for detecting.
* Worked on a roadmap for future work as discussed in the previous meeting.
* Worked on player detection. Explored Video Google based approach(player recognition using T-shirt) and ssd based approach. General player detection(using person recognition) found feasible. 
* Search structure re-implemented for website.
* **Annotated the data** so that it can be used to derive features using learning techniques.

# Plan for next week
* Work on foul detection.
* Deploy more demo videos based on player detection.
* Use NLP tools to improve search accuracy.
* Pre-processing dataset
