# Honours Project Meeting
## 09 October, 2018

Attendees: Anvesh, Dheeraj, Jawahar sir

# Talking Points
- Done with collection of videos (our dataset)
- No work apart from that has been done, we're still not clear on the idea
- Sir has suggested to start off with a simple problem since the simple problem will also have several issues that we're not thinking of.
- Sir has suggested we work on stages, with stage 1 being simple SDE work.
- Stage 1: Segment all videos naively in 30 seconds - 1 minute range, index based on metadata (such as teams involved, competition stage, etc). Each query should give search results
- Stage 2: Use holistic features such as audio level, average colour, average sound, image features, sound features, video features(like motion features, color features), etc to segment/index
- Stage 3 may be a novel problem


# Actionable Points
- Complete Stage 1 by next meeting
