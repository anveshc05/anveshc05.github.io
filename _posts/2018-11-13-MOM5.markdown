# Honours Project Meeting
## 13 November, 2018

Attendees: Anvesh, Dheeraj, Jawahar sir

# Talking Points
- Tried video google, seems feasible
- Pipeline: Apply NLP for search, features to split clips at backend
- Maybe use BOW for search
- Do event detection, perhaps around 10 of them (goalposts, goals, freekicks, player track, counter attack, fouls, cards, corners)
- In winter break, going to update blog every week
- Need more ADA space
- Jawahar sir suggested that UI is too bleak. Need to first finish off easy stuff and then move onto CV.
- Also, search results are not very informative. Specify titles clearly, then paginate the results.
- Not just group stage, do for all matches

# Actionable Points
- Complete redesign of UI
- Collect more features
