# Progress
* Some feature extraction techniques tried including **sound intensity** , **colour**. 
* Worked on goal detection and acheived decent results.
* **Video google** tried for player recognition and found to be compute intensive.
* Website completely restructured and redeployed.

# Plan for next week
* Integrate all the work on the new website so that it can be easily presented.
* Improve the goal detection by adding multiple features to improve accuracy.
* Adding new features like foul detection. 
* Isolating moments in which crowd and celebrations are shown.
* Clean dataset to remove pre-match/ mid-match shows.
* Use NLP tools to improve search accuracy.
